# Purpose

This repository investigates the hypothesis that nations with higher per capita GDP are more likely to protect their coastal ecosystems. This hypothesis is derived from the general knowledge that protecting ecosystems takes a large amount of resources. Policy must be put in place to create these protected areas. Countries with a higher per capita GDP would, in theory, have a greater amount of resources to spend on creating these zones.

The type of ecosystem and the total area of a specific type of coastal ecosystem are also included as predictors in this analysis as they are confounding variables. The directed acyclic graph shows the assumption that the ecosystem type affects the proportion of area that is protected. Some ecosystems are more valuable for a nation monetarily if they are not protected. For example, locations where fishing is important for the economy may be difficult to create as designated protected areas. Additionally, depending on the type of protection of an ecosystem, officially protecting an area may be implausible as surrounding communities may be reliant on the ecosystem to make a living and/or survive.

Total area is another confounding variable for proportion protected area as the more area a nation has of a specific ecosystem the less area they need to protect to achieve a higher percentage of proportion protected area. One example in which I would expect this to largely influence proportion protected area is in small island nations where they have a large area of coastal ecosystems. Even if they protect a greater area than another nation their proportion of protected area may be low.

# Data

## Data Access

The original data comes from the [Ocean+Habitats](https://habitats.oceanplus.org/) webpage which works to inform policy about the state of our oceans coastlines, focusing on metrics concerning ocean protection. This analysis focuses on the five ecosystems for which data is available. The five ecosystems are cold-water corals, mangroves, salt marshes, sea grasses, and warm-water corals.

Per capita GDP data was acquired from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD).

All of the data is publicly available.

## Data Processing

Data cleaning was performed in a separate file with the final product being a clean dataframe that contains only the appropriate variables for this analysis.

First we'll load in the appropriate libraries.

```{r}
#| output: false

# load in appropriate libraries
library(DescTools)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(glmmTMB)
library(kableExtra)
library(broom.mixed)

set.seed(12)
```

Let's read in the data.

```{r}
#| ouput: false 

# read in clean data
coastal_ecosystem <- read_csv(here::here("gdp_coastal_ecosystem.csv"))
```

We'll create an initial plot visualizing how per capita GDP influences percent protected areas differentiating between ecosystems.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(data = coastal_ecosystem, aes(x = pc_gdp_2016, 
                                     y = percent_protected, 
                                     color = ecosystem)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Ecosystem",
                     values = c("#D51977", 
                                "forestgreen", 
                                "#273E47", 
                                "#9BC1BC", 
                                "#FEA82F"),
                     labels = c("Cold-water coral",
                                "Mangroves", 
                                "Salt marsh",
                                "Seagrass",
                                "Warm-water coral")) +
  labs(x= "Per Capita GDP ($USD)",
       y = "Percent protected",
       title = print("2016 Percent Protected Areas by GDP")) +
  theme_classic()
```

At first glance the data does not follow any general trends, but we can run a statistical model to better assess any relationship between the predictors of per capita GDP, total area, and ecosystem on the response proportion protected. Since our data shows change in proportion we will be using a beta regression model.

Here is our proposed model based on our understanding of the variable interactions. The ecosystems are individual predictors in this model since they are dummy variables. Cold-water corals are the reference level since `R` defines the reference alphabetically. Therefore, there is no dummy variable for cold-water coral.
$$
\begin{align}
\text{ProportionProtected} &\sim BetaRegression(\mu, \phi) \\
logit(\mu) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{GDP}+ \beta_2 \text{TotalArea}+ \beta_3 \text{Mangroves} + \beta_4 \text{Saltmarshes}+ \beta_5 \text{Seagrass}+ \beta_6 \text{Warmwater Corals}
\end{align}
$$

# Simulating data

We simulate data to make sure we understand the model before using the model on our real world data. To ensure we truly understand the model we want to simulate data, then run the beta regression with the output being similar values to those we gave it when first creating the data parameters.

We only simulate data for the per capita GDP variable as our hypothesis is that per capita GDP is positively influencing proportion protected area. Since per capita GDP is a numeric predictor we can use the `runif` function to create variable values within a given range.

```{r}
# assign values to our intercept and slope
beta0 <- 0.6
beta1 <- 1.9

# simulate the predictor data
# gdp <- seq(from = 433, to = 71000, by = 500)

# simulate predictor values 
gdp <- runif(10000, 0.433, 0.71)

# linkspace equation
logit_mu <- beta0 + beta1 * gdp

# assign value to phi 
phi <- 15 # this is shape1+shape2

# calculate mu based on betas and simulated data 
mu <- 1 / (1 + exp(-logit_mu)) # this is shape1/(shape1+shape2)
```


To simulate values for the response variable we use `rbeta`. This requires the above parameters we have already assigned. According to the documentation, `shape1` and `shape2` are two variables that need to be calculated with `mu` and `phi`.

```{r}
# calculate the parameters for rbeta
shape1 <- mu * phi
shape2 <- phi - shape1

# simulate response data based on parameters assigned above 
proportion_protected_sim <- rbeta(10000, shape1 = shape1, shape2 = shape2)

# create a dataframe with the variables
sim_df <- tibble(proportion_protected_sim, gdp )

# run the model based on the simulated data 
sim_model <- glmmTMB(proportion_protected_sim ~ gdp,
  data = sim_df,
  family = beta_family(link = "logit"))

# make sure the values are close to the assigned variables
# summary(sim_model)

tidy(sim_model) |> 
  mutate(p.value = ifelse(p.value < 0.001,
                     "p < 0.001",
                     as.character(p.value))) |> 
  kable() |> 
  kable_styling()

```

Running a beta regression model on the simulated data outputs values that are close to those values we originally assigned to the variables. This is a sign we understand our model enough to move onto fitting the model on our own data!

# Data preparation

The beta regression model only works on proportion so here we change `percent_protected` to `proportion_protected`.

```{r}
 coastal_ecosystem <- coastal_ecosystem |> 
  mutate( proportion_protected = (percent_protected /100))
```

The beta regression model uses the link function `logit`. Logit does not work on 0's and 1's. We need to adjust the data to transform any 0's and 1's to slightly above 0 and slightly below 1. Here's a function created based on the vignette's description of how to handle these values.

```{r}
zeros_and_ones <- function(y){
    n_obs <- sum(!is.na(y))
    (y * (n_obs - 1) + 0.5) / n_obs
}
```

Then we adjust the non-numeric values to numeric and apply the `zeros_and_ones` function to our proportion data.

```{r}
coastal_ecosystem <- coastal_ecosystem |> 
  mutate(total_area = as.numeric(total_area)) |> 
  mutate(adj_proportion_protected = zeros_and_ones(y = proportion_protected))
```

# Beta Regression

Let's remind ourselves of the statistical notation of our investigation. 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{ProportionProtected} &\sim BetaRegression(\mu, \phi) \\
logit(\mu) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{GDP}+ \beta_2 \text{TotalArea}+ \beta_3 \text{Mangroves} + \beta_4 \text{Saltmarshes}+ \beta_5 \text{Seagrass}+ \beta_6 \text{Warmwater Corals}
\end{align}
$$

## Hypothesis statistical notation

$$
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \beta_1 = 0 \\
H_A &: \beta_1 > 0
\end{align}
$$ 

The hypothesis as described in full detail in the introduction is that per capita GDP has a positive effect on the proportion of protected area. The null hypothesis is that per capita GDP does not have a positive effect on the proportion of protected area.

## Fit a beta regression model

Again to reiterate, the beta regression model is useful when the response is a proportion. Since the protected areas are between the proportions of 0 and 1 this model will assess whether there is any relationship between the predictors, per capita GDP, total area, and ecosystem type, and the response, proportion protected.

```{r}
# run the beta regression model on our data
coastal_ecosystem_model <- glmmTMB(adj_proportion_protected ~ pc_gdp_2016 + total_area + ecosystem,
  data = coastal_ecosystem,
  family = beta_family(link = "logit"))

# summarize the model results to late call out the values
sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod <- summary(coastal_ecosystem_model)
```

We can use `broom.mixed::tidy()` to make an aesthetic summary table of our model. When originally running the `tidy()` function some of the p-values were zero since the table does not round. We use an `ifelse()` statement to replace anywhere with a p-value less than 0.001 to simply state "p < 0.001." P-values that are less than 0.001 show statistical significance since there is an extremely low probability of getting those values by chance alone. 

```{r}
# create a tidy version of this dataframe
tidy(coastal_ecosystem_model) |>
   mutate(p.value = ifelse(p.value < 0.001,
                     "p < 0.001",
                     as.character(p.value))) |> 
  kable() |>
  kable_styling()
```

## Hypothesis test

We reject the null hypothesis that per capita GDP does not have a positive effect on the proportion of protected area for coastal ecosystems. The beta value for per capita GDP is low but positive at `r sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[2]`. This value makes sense since per capita GDP changes by the thousands. The p-value is less than 0.05 meaning that the liklihood that these findings are due to random chance are extremely low. The effect of per capita GDP on proportion protected area for coastal ecosystems is statistically significant.

### Predicions

Now that we ran the beta regression with the `glmmTMB` function let's create prediction lines based on ecosystem. We create data that shows the spread of the expected values for per capita GDP.

Here we use `seq()` to create values in the range of our real world data by a specific interval. We also want all of the ecosystems in the prediction grid. Every unique variation between the sequenced along per capita GDP values and different ecosystem type is included in the prediction grid. We keep the total area variable constant by using the mean since the values are numeric.

```{r}

pred_grid <- expand_grid(pc_gdp_2016 = seq(from = 433, to = 71000, by = 500),
                            ecosystem = unique(coastal_ecosystem$ecosystem)) |> 
  mutate(total_area = mean(coastal_ecosystem$total_area, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Let's run create prediction values for most probable protected proportion based on the different combinations of possible per capita GDP and ecosystems holding total area constant. This uses the `glmmTMB` model we already specified above to calculate what the protected proportion values are

WHY CAN WE STAY IN "RESPONSE" SPACE?

```{r}
coastal_model_pred <- pred_grid |> 
  mutate(predict =  predict(object = coastal_ecosystem_model,
                          newdata = pred_grid,
                          type = "response")) 
```

Let's plot the predictions, differentiating by ecosystem.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(data = coastal_model_pred, aes(x = pc_gdp_2016, y = predict)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = ecosystem))+
  scale_color_manual(name = "Ecosystem",
                     values = c("#D51977", 
                                "forestgreen", 
                                "#273E47", 
                                "#9BC1BC", 
                                "#FEA82F"),
                     labels = c("Cold-water coral",
                                "Mangroves", 
                                "Salt marsh",
                                "Seagrass",
                                "Warm-water coral")) +
  labs(x= "Per Capita GDP ($USD)",
       y = "Percent protected",
       title = print("2016 Percent Protected Areas by GDP")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### What does this graph show?

The prediction lines are broken up by ecosystem. Across the board, all of the ecosystems are more likely to be protected the higher the per capita GDP is in a country. Salt marshes are the most likely to be protected followed by mangroves, warm-water coral, and sea grasses. Cold-water corrals are the least likely to be protected.

Key takeaway: Overall, as GDP increases the expected proportion of protected areas increases, regardless of the ecosystem type.

# Confidence Interval

Typically, we can use the predict function to calculate confidence intervals. Unfortunately, the various models that run beta regressions do not allow us to create confidence intervals using the predict function so we calculate these by bootstrapping and by hand below.

```{r}
#| eval: false

coastal_model_se <- predict(object = coastal_ecosystem_model,
                          newdata = pred_grid,
                          type = "link", # stay in link space
                          se.fit = TRUE,
                          component = "cond") # get the SE of the fit

```
## Beta's individual Confidence Intervals

The values from our summary model are utilized to create the confidence intervals for the individual beta values.

First, we'll access the individual beta values from the summary table as well as the standard error values from the summary table.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

beta0 <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[1]
beta1 <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[2]
beta2 <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[3]
beta3_mangroves <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[4]
beta3_saltmarsh <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[5]
beta3_seagrass <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[6]
beta3_warmwater_coral <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[7]

se <- sum_coastal_ecosystem_mod$coefficients$cond[, "Std. Error"]
```

Confidence intervals are then calculated subtracting and adding one standard error from each beta value.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

# Beta 0 confidence intervals
beta0_CI_lwr <- beta0 - (1.96* se[1])
beta0_CI_upr <- beta0 + (1.96* se[1])

# Beta 1 confidence intervals
beta1_CI_lwr <- beta1 - (1.96* se[2])
beta1_CI_upr <- beta1 + (1.96* se[2])

# Beta 2 confidence intervals
beta2_CI_lwr <- beta2 - (1.96* se[3])
beta2_CI_upr <- beta2 + (1.96* se[3])

# Beta 3 mangrove confidence intervals
beta3_man_CI_lwr <- beta3_mangroves - (1.96* se[4])
beta3_man_CI_upr <- beta3_mangroves + (1.96* se[4])

# Beta 3 saltmarsh confidence intervals
beta3_salt_CI_lwr <- beta3_saltmarsh - (1.96* se[5])
beta3_salt_CI_upr <- beta3_saltmarsh + (1.96* se[5])

# Beta 3 seagrass confidence intervals
beta3_seag_CI_lwr <- beta3_seagrass - (1.96* se[6])
beta3_seag_CI_upr <- beta3_seagrass + (1.96* se[6])

# Beta 3 confidence intervals
beta3_wwc_CI_lwr <- beta3_warmwater_coral - (1.96* se[7])
beta3_wwc_CI_upr <- beta3_warmwater_coral + (1.96* se[7])

```

Finally, let's create a dataframe with the beta's confidence interval values.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

CI_df <- tibble(
  Variable = c("Intercept", "GDP", "Total Area", "Mangroves", "Saltmarsh", "Seagrass", "Warm-water Coral"),
  BetaValues = c(beta0, beta1, beta2, beta3_mangroves, beta3_saltmarsh, beta3_seagrass, beta3_warmwater_coral),
  LowerCI = c(beta0_CI_lwr, beta1_CI_lwr, beta2_CI_lwr, beta3_man_CI_lwr, beta3_salt_CI_lwr, beta3_seag_CI_lwr, beta3_wwc_CI_lwr),
  UpperCI =c(beta0_CI_upr, beta1_CI_upr, beta2_CI_upr, beta3_man_CI_upr, beta3_salt_CI_upr, beta3_seag_CI_upr, beta3_wwc_CI_upr)
) 

CI_df |> 
  kable() |> 
  kable_styling()

```

These confidence intervals are values for the individual predictors and show the confidence interval only based on that one variable.

The total area confidence interval includes zero in its range. This signifies that total area does not have an effect on proportion protected area. The effect size includes zero

Sea grass

The ecosystem's beta values' confidence interval ranges are all positive and do not include zero. `R` uses the first ecosystem alphabetically as the reference. In this case the reference is cold-water coral. The confidence interval ranges indicate similarly to the prediction lines calculated by bootstrapping and applying the `predict ()` function that all of the ecosystems are more likely to be protected than cold-water corals.

## Prediction Lines Confidence Intervals

### Bootstrap Data

We can calculate the confidence intervals for predictions by constructing bootstraps. Bootstraps are run by sampling our original data with replacement. Since we have 446 rows of data in our data frame, we can choose to select 446 samples in the boot per bootstrap calculated for consistency. Below we are running a bootstrap 1000 times.

```{r}
# reiterate through the boot 1000 times
boot <-  map_dfr(1:1000, \(i) {

  # sample with replacement
  boot_sample <- slice_sample(coastal_ecosystem, n=446, replace = TRUE)
  
  # run a beta regression on every single boot sample
  boot_mod <- glmmTMB(adj_proportion_protected ~ pc_gdp_2016 + total_area + ecosystem,
                      family = beta_family(link = "logit"),
                      data = boot_sample)

    # predict the boots values (the outcomes are best fit lines)
  mutate(pred_grid,
         adj_prop_protected = predict(object = boot_mod,
                          newdata = pred_grid,
                          type = "response"),
         boot = i)
})
```

Then we create a data frame calculating the confidence intervals from the bootstrapped values.

```{r}
boot_ci <- boot |> group_by(pc_gdp_2016, ecosystem) |> 
  summarise(adj_prop_protected_lwr = quantile(adj_prop_protected, 0.025),
            adj_prop_protected_upr = quantile(adj_prop_protected, 0.975))
```

Let's plot the confidence intervals for the predictions differentiating for ecosystems.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(coastal_model_pred, aes(x = pc_gdp_2016)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = boot_ci, 
              aes(ymin = adj_prop_protected_lwr, 
                         ymax = adj_prop_protected_upr, 
                         fill = ecosystem), 
              alpha = 0.2) +
    scale_fill_manual(name = "Ecosystem",
                     values = c(coldwater_coral = "#D51977", 
                               mangroves = "forestgreen", 
                                saltmarshes = "#273E47", 
                               seagrasses = "#9BC1BC", 
                                warm_coral = "#FEA82F"),
                     labels = c("Cold-water coral",
                                "Mangroves", 
                                "Salt marsh",
                                "Sea grass",
                                "Warm-water coral")) +
  geom_line(aes(color = ecosystem, y = predict)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Ecosystem",
                     values = c(coldwater_coral = "#D51977", 
                                mangroves = "forestgreen", 
                                saltmarshes = "#273E47", 
                                seagrasses = "#9BC1BC", 
                                warm_coral = "#FEA82F"),
                     labels = c("Cold-water coral",
                                "Mangroves", 
                                "Salt marsh",
                                "Seagrass",
                                "Warm-water coral")) +
  labs(x= "Per Capita GDP ($USD)",
       y = "Percent protected",
       title = print("2016 Percent Protected Areas by GDP")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The confident intervals on the predictions show the variation for the different ecosystems based on all of the predictors. The confidence intervals for the mangroves, salt marshes, sea grasses, and warm-water corals are all overlapping. This shows that the differences between the effect of per capita GDP on the protection of these ecosystems do not greatly differ from each other. Cold-water coral
